## Features

1. Flexbox
2. CSS Grid
3. Grid positioning
4. Using SVGs etc.

## Challenges

I thought that it would be simple project, but it turned out to be quite difficult one.
Especially the fact that I had to figure out how to position everything with Grid (which I thought was simple as well). In some places I used Flexbox, because it was rather challenging to use Grid. 
Also not gonna lie I watched some solutions, because my positioning was breaking for some reasons.

But after some struggling I managed to complete this project.
